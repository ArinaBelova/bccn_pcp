# bccn_pcp

A repository for a code of the Connect4 game written during a software engineering course taught at BCCN Berlin.
The project consists of two parts:

1. Implementation of a simple minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. (Done)
2. Implementation of a more sophisticated algorithm, like Deep Q Learning. (WIP)
